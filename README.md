# Real-Time Fire Detection using YOLOv12

This project demonstrates a real-time **fire detection system** using a **YOLOv12** model trained on the **Roboflow Fire Dataset**. It uses **OpenCV** to access the webcam and display live detection, and **pyttsx3** for voice-based alerts.

##  Features

-  Real-time detection using your webcam
-  Voice feedback using `pyttsx3`
-  Powered by YOLOv12 (Ultralytics)
-  Easy to run and modify
-  Trained using Roboflow dataset
